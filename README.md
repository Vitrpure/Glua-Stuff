# GLua Stuff
Here I have made this for people that don't feel like making the jobs, shipments, categories themselves you are free to take anything here. If there are any issues just make one to this repo and I will try to fix it or you can request a certain job or something.

# How to install

1. Have DarkRP Modification installed on your DarkRP Server
2. Goto Garrys mod -> Addons -> DarkRP Modification -> Custom Things
3. open jobs.lua/shipments.lua/categories.lua
4. Copy the text from One of our GLua files
5. Paste into one of the lua files ( jobs.lua/shipments.lua/categories.lua )
6. It explains what to do in there!
